/*Que 11 : Frequencies of limited Range Array Elements
Given an array A[] of N positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to P where
elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. Your task is to count the
frequency of all elements from 1 to N.
Note: The elements greater than N in the array can be ignored for counting and do modify
the array in-place.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {2, 3, 2, 3, 5}
P = 5
Output:
0 2 2 0 1
Explanation: Counting frequencies of each array element
We have:
1 occurring 0 times.
2 occurring 2 times.
3 occurring 2 times.
4 occurring 0 times.
5 occurring 1 time.
